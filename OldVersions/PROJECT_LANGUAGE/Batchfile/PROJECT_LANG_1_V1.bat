:: About:
:: I decided to make Batchfile the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Batchfile) as Batchfile is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Batchfile programming language. It only makes sense to make Batchfile the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
